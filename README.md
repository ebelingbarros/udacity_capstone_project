# Spiced Data Science bootcamp final project: NLP and Sentiment Analysis with oil and renewable energy articles

## Libraries

The code presented in this repository was written in Python 3. These are the main Python packages required for it to work: `Pandas`, `Numpy`, `Seaborn`, `Plotly`, `Matplotlib`, `Sklearn`, `Statsmodels`, `BeautifulSoup`, `Requests`, `Json`, `Spacy`, `Streamlit`, `NetworkX`,  `SqlAlchemy` and `Altair`.

## File Descriptions
- [capstone_notebook.ipynb](https://github.com/ebelingbarros/udacity_capstone_project/blob/main/capstone_notebook.ipynb): The code contained in this Jupyter notebook cleans and prepares the data, carries out the EDA analysis and generates the Machine Learning regression model. 
- data: The folder contains the [exame500.csv](https://github.com/ebelingbarros/udacity_capstone_project/blob/main/data/exame500.csv) csv file, in which the data for the project is stored.

### Streamlit sites and code
- The ["NYC Uber Ridesharing Data"](https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/demo-uber-nyc-pickups/) and the ["Público, crítica y taquilla en IMDb"](https://share.streamlit.io/casiopa/eda-imdb/main/src/utils/streamlit/EDA_IMDb_main.py) Streamlit apps where awesome sources of inspiration for its structuration.

- The simple co-ocurrence network analysis is based on [Gin04kg's](https://www.kaggle.com/itoeiji/simple-co-occurrence-network) notebook.

- The estimation of a Random Forest models for, respectively, oil prices and renewable energy consumption, considering sentiment analysis is based on [Bee Guan Teo's](https://python.plainenglish.io/how-to-predict-stock-prices-change-with-random-forest-in-python-f707e101d5c4) notebook.
